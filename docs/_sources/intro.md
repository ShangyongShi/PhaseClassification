# Improvements on Phase Classification

Welcome to the Jupyterbook of the Phase Classification project!

In this website, we aim to introduce to you our new phase classification method that we present at the AGU 2023 meeting. Since the work is still under review, we would not present the original codes and data at this stage. But once the paper is published, the code package for the method and other updated analysis codes and data would be updated here. 

Check out the content pages to see more.



PS: I am building this website by myself, driven by pure interest. This is my first trial on JupyterBook, so everything is just basic and simple. It was intended to provide more complete information than the poster, but I planned to use it as the documentation page for future code share. If you have any suggestions on how to build a good documentation page, I am more than happy to discuss with you!
